My name is Zifan Wang (王子凡). I mostly go by Atticus. Here is my [CV](/website/cv.pdf).

As of fall 2024, I am a junior at MIT studying pure math. I am interested in homotopy theory and many of its adjacent areas.

I also dabble in physics, music, and machine learning.

In a parallel universe, I may be a guitarist, a chemist, or a writer.

> As for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, no one knows where, a sheep we never saw has or has not eaten a rose... Look up at the sky. Ask yourself: \"Has the sheep eaten the flower or not?\" And you will see how everything changes...
