My name is Zifan Wang (王子凡). I mostly go by Atticus.

As of summer 2024, I am a rising junior at MIT studying pure math, primarily interested in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. 

I also dabble in physics and machine learning.

In a parallel universe, I may be a guitarist, a chemist, or a writer.
