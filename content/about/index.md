My name is Zifan Wang (王子凡). I mostly go by Atticus. Yes, it was inspired by that novel.

I'm a sophomore at MIT studying pure math, primarily interested in homotopy theory and algebraic geometry. Right now, I'm learning chromatic homotopy theory. 

I also dabble in physics and machine learning. Recently I became interested in formalizing mathematics using Lean.

In a parallel universe, I may be a guitarist, a chemist, or a writer.
