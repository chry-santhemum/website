This post is aimed at those who don't already know Lie theory very well. 

The Killing form sees a lot of the structure of your Lie algebra.

Let's work over a field of characteristic zero. Let $\fg$ be a Lie algebra. 
Recall that it always has the adjoint representation: $\fg \to \gl(\fg)$.
Then there is always a canonical bilinear form on $\fg$, the *Killing form*:

$$B(x,y) = \Tr(\ad x \circ \ad y).$$
