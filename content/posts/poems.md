Most of these poems were written during fall 2023 for the class 21W.771, taught by Prof. Erica Funkhouser. The painting on the cover is _L'Estaque_ by Paul Cézanne.

## Vertigo


From dizzying heights, the earth we once knew \
drifted into a sea of whispers.

Not snow-capped peaks, nor treacherous straits \
could stop us anymore. 

We flew over the town in half-light. \
Soft shadows scaled the low walls. The place

where every road began. The air was brisk, \
the foam sparkled rose-gold, the moon

pale and crystalline. We were no longer \
just a burning memory.

And with a gasp I was wide awake, flailing fists \
where my majestic wings had been. Soaring so high

I could not see the ground. So I cried and cried— and then, \
into the thick haze, began my faithful falling—


## 6 Tankas


### One

Outside, an instant \
passed, and I woke up ashore. \
If I were Vincent \
which shade of pastel blue can \
reveal the sky's secret door?

### Two

When your meteor crashed \
Into my world, \
These long-extinct forms \
Came back to life \
As flames licked and undid \
Glacial epochs of time.


### Three

After the downpour, cats emerged from underground abodes, \
along with bottles of amber promises \
ready to be reborn.

### Four

A day's false start \
Starts with yesterday's \
Hangover, a wet wool carpet hangs above \
Train tracks, drawing smoke \
from faraway chimneys.


### Five

afternoon— skipped class, \
sitting by the black marble \
and white oak trees, you \
watched the warm sunlight reflect \
and dance on three thousand lives.


### Six

The wind scatters \
in the evening bells. \
The azure dome \
recedes into the heaven. \
My mother and father \
walking, hand in hand.



## Ode

_To my mother_

Earth has undergone\
ten revolutions, and I still\
rip off page after page\
from my notebook, till I've drained\
all its soul, futile ink\
seeped into imperfections, its powers\
dissolved. And every\
&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193; abrasive, intimate\
note, roots and fibers crumpled,\
lacerated,\
is tender reminder\
of your hysteria\
and my defeat,\
&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193; and that awful\
relic— unbearable scar on your abdomen\
like a hallowed parasite\
I left you with. A pain so vivid\
and tidal, neither of us\
had asked for, but a glimpse of the prelude\
and the\
&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193; epilogue. And in between\
I was the only miracle\
that tried to be. And I tried\
not to be you, I have\
tried so, so very hard\
to be good to me. And in the end\
our distance saved us from our mutual\
altruisms.\
&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193;&#8193; And last time\
I called, you said you found peace,\
and I think I found mine,\
too, and I'm glad\
we both did. You had so often said:\
One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

## Interstellar

Stay. Take a picture of that polaroid \
Before the color fades, even if you don’t know \
Memory, like water, leaks from every broken vessel. \
Tie up the loose ends. Say sorry, even if you don’t mean it, \
Before you enter: \
Smiling and finally feeling brave enough \
To wave at those faces across the turnstile.


## Aubade of the Insomniac


No sleep, not tonight. The hours before daybreak \
Size you up with violet cat-eyes \
And with a thud, \
locked behind the insomniac's bedroom door.

Half-past four, finding yourself\
on streets which cannot remember where to end.\
Cloaked specters linger at the corner:\
"Memory! You have the key..."\
In a former life, these stars were once\
Embers spiraling into the sky.
 
You walk past the old playground.\
"I never sleep, only dream," says the insomniac.\
You don't know which way to go, only that you must go:\
Elsewhere.\
To that little hill where you discovered at five\
Rocks shaped like dogs' ears.\
Shadows scuttle under the bamboos.\
What waltzes across the grass is you.\
The first season of the years.
 
Past the horizon, something stirred:\
a flicker, at first, and suddenly the lights \
Burst forth, all at once:\
A Titan awakened from an ancient dream.\
Deep inside the city of ice, its blood-red heart beats\
on every window, its pulse filling cracks and crevices\
of every room.\
To the insomniac, dawn is liberation, salvation,\
Deliverance, rebirth, nirvana. A chance to live again.\
Inside your room, the alarm clock sings its aubade. No one came.


## Death of the Poet

On the morning on which the poet dies,\
The meadowlark does not stop her song.
 
The missile-heads will slit open the blue wound anew.\
The young gods keep on making love.
 
No parade, or crusade, will put on display\
The poet's green, fatigued cadaver\
as it had once wished. Indeed, it would look\
much, much better in a blazing pyre.
 
But when, beyond the lagoons and beyond whispering pines,\
His wandering soul knocks on Heaven's lofty gates,
 
The keeper, recognizing his footsteps,\
will greet him warmly and offer a place to stay:
 
And before dawn, he will have sailed away without a farewell\
For the pink light which lined the horizon of his every waking dream…


## From the New World

For you, it might just be a tiny dot.\
A tiny red dot in tonight's lustrous sky.

You pulled back the curtains:\
You couldn't wait for sunrise.

But it's all wind and dust down here.\
It creeps into every corner.

It creeps inside my bedroom. \
It forms the soft defiance in every pillow.\
The substance of every dream.

I wake up to the chirping of skylarks.\
Sometimes it snows, but it doesn't rain.\
In August one could hear the cicadas.

I sing *An die Freude* to my bathroom mirror.\
These machines are old, and I am dying.\
I play the same record over and over.

Now the wind rises. Must we try to live?\
I push my face against this distance\
This great emptiness.\
Word and song seems so pale.\
And poetry so futile.

Oh, the mysteries of life!\
Where did it begin? Where does it end?

You couldn't wait for sunrise.\
You pulled back the curtains:

A tiny red dot in tonight's lustrous sky.\
For you, it might just be a tiny dot.


## Legend of the Knight

_Translated from the [original poem](https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E4%BF%A0%E5%AE%A2%E8%A1%8C_(%E6%9D%8E%E7%99%BD)) ​​​​by Li Bai (701--762 AD)_
 
 
​​A warrior from Zhao in a tasseled hat,\
​​His fine blade gleaming like frost.\
​​Silver saddle on a white horse,\
​He rides, swift as a meteor.\
​​Every ten steps he kills another man.\
He could go a thousand miles leaving no trace.\
​When it's finished, he will be gone\
​Without leaving a name.\
​He came along to Lord Xin Ling\
​Laid his sword in front of his knees.\
Feasting with Zhu Hai, and\
​Holding the glass high, toasted to Hou Ying.\
After three cups, they made a pledge for life and death,\
​​Those sacred mountains seemed so little in comparison.\
All drunk with sight blurred and ears red,\
​​Their spirits high in the pale rainbows.\
​Waving a golden hammer, Zhao was saved;\
The city was in awe.\
Their stories were told in the capital\
For a thousand autumns to come.\
​​Even in death, their chivalries are unparalleled\
​​Among heroes of the land.\
​Who would rather sit beneath their bookshelves,\
Spending their whole life on some magnum opus?
