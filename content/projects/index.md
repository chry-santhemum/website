## Notes

I put all my math notes in one [file](/website/all.pdf). It is, of course, a work in progress. Comments and suggestions are very much appreciated. 


## Reading

Currently I am learning:
- Chromatic homotopy theory
- Geometric quantization
- D-modules

Talk to me if you want to recommend a book, share ideas, chat, or read something together!
