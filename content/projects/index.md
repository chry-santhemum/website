## Reading

I have a list of topics I want to learn (not shown here). Talk to me if you want to recommend a book, share ideas, or read something together.

Currently:

- Étale cohomology, mainly following [Freitag & Kiehl](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-02541-3).

- Representation theory of Lie groups, mainly following [Bröcker & tom Dieck](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-12918-0) and [Fulton & Harris](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0979-9).
