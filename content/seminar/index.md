A comprehensive list is compiled by Yuri Sulyma [here](https://ysulyma.github.io/prismatic).

General:
- Bhatt's [ICM address](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12010v1). Overview of main developments and applications without proofs.
- Bhatt, [Columbia lectures](https://www.math.ias.edu/~bhatt/teaching/prismatic-columbia/). Develops the theory of prisms from scratch and proves the main comparison theorems.
- Kedlaya's [course notes](https://kskedlaya.org/prismatic/prismatic.html). Largely drawn from the Columbia lectures but fills in a lot of prerequisites.
- Emerton's [course notes](https://math.uchicago.edu/~emerton/prismatic/prismatic.html).

Stacky:
- Drinfeld, [stacky approach to crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11853), [prismatization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04746), and a related [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wCk3qsFWLA). The talk is very understandable. 
- Bhatt--Lurie [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06120), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06124)
- Bhatt, [prismatic F-gauges](https://www.math.ias.edu/~bhatt/teaching/mat549f22/lectures.pdf). Probably the most accessible out of all three.

Topology:
- BMS 1, 2
- Krause--Nikolaus, course notes on THH. Very accessible introduction and the lectures are on youtube.
- Nikolaus--Scholze, cyclotomic spectra.
- Hahn--Raksit--Wilson, even filtration
