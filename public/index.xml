      <description>Most of these poems were written during fall 2023 for the class 21W.771, taught by Prof. Erica Funkhouser. The painting on the cover is L&amp;rsquo;Estaque by Paul Cézanne.
Vertigo From dizzying heights, the earth we once knew drifted into a sea of whispers.
Not snow-capped peaks, nor treacherous straits could stop us anymore.
We flew over the town in half-light. Soft shadows scaled the low walls. The place
where every road began.</description>

      <description>My name is Zifan Wang (王子凡). I mostly go by Atticus. Yes, it was inspired by that novel.
I&amp;rsquo;m a sophomore at MIT studying pure math, primarily interested in homotopy theory and algebraic geometry. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m learning chromatic homotopy theory.
I also dabble in physics and machine learning. Recently I became interested in formalizing mathematics using Lean.
In a parallel universe, I may be a guitarist, a chemist, or a writer.</description>

      <description>Notes I put all my math notes in one file. It is, of course, a work in progress. Comments and suggestions are very much appreciated.
Currently I am learning:
