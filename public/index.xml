      <description>$\newcommand{\pard}[2]{\frac{\partial #1}{\partial #2}} \newcommand{\ZZ}{\mathbb{Z}} \newcommand{\QQ}{\mathbb{Q}} \newcommand{\GG}{\mathbb{G}} \newcommand{\FF}{\mathbb{F}} \DeclareMathOperator{\nil}{nil} \DeclareMathOperator{\Spec}{Spec} \DeclareMathOperator{\Spf}{Spf} \DeclareMathOperator{\Ab}{Ab}$Before diving into stacks, I&amp;rsquo;d like to stay in the elementary situation a bit longer and discuss an important construction: the logarithm.
Over the initial ring $\ZZ$ (hence over any ring $R$), we have two very basic examples of FGLs:
The additive group, $\GG_a(x,y)=x+y$; The multiplicative group, $\GG_m(x,y)=xy+x+y$. (I probably should have called them $\widehat{\GG}_a$ and $\widehat{\GG}_m$ but let&amp;rsquo;s not go there yet.</description>

      <description>$\newcommand{\ZZ}{\mathbb{Z}} \newcommand{\FF}{\mathbb{F}} \DeclareMathOperator{\nil}{nil} \DeclareMathOperator{\Spec}{Spec} \DeclareMathOperator{\Spf}{Spf} \DeclareMathOperator{\Ab}{Ab}$This stuff is all standard material and there are a ton of good expositions on this topic, but I thought this would be a good place to begin because the theory of formal groups starts out being really quite elementary, but it quickly goes pretty deep and reaches into a couple of surprising places.
Before telling you what a formal group is, let me tell you what a formal group law is, which is something arguably easier to describe.</description>

      <description>My name is Zifan Wang (王子凡). I mostly go by Atticus. Here is my CV.
As of fall 2024, I am a junior at MIT studying pure math, primarily interested in homotopy theory and adjacent areas.
I also dabble in physics, music, and machine learning.
In a parallel universe, I may be a guitarist, a chemist, or a writer.
As for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, no one knows where, a sheep we never saw has or has not eaten a rose&amp;hellip; Look up at the sky.</description>

      <description>Notes from talks Integrable connections, for STAGE seminar fall 2024. pdf Notes I took for talks at the Talbot workshop: Talk 4 given by Jackson, Talk 11 given by Isabel. Others Here&amp;rsquo;s the big dumpster (no longer being updated here). At some point in the future, I hope to turn this into a legible book of some sort.</description>
