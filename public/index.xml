      <description>My name is Zifan Wang (王子凡). I mostly go by Atticus. Here is my CV.
As of fall 2024, I am a junior at MIT studying pure math. I am interested in homotopy theory and many of its adjacent areas.
I also dabble in physics, music, and machine learning.
In a parallel universe, I may be a guitarist, a chemist, or a writer.
As for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, no one knows where, a sheep we never saw has or has not eaten a rose&amp;hellip; Look up at the sky.</description>
