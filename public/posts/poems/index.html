Were we no longer just a burning memory?\nAnd with a gasp I was wide awake, flailing fists where my majestic wings had been. Soaring so high\nI could not see the ground.

And every\nabrasive, intimate\nnote, roots and fibers crumpled,\nlacerated,\nis tender reminder\nof your hysteria\nand my defeat,\nand that awful\nrelic— unbearable scar on your abdomen\nlike a hallowed parasite\nI left you with.

Take a picture of that polaroid Before the color fades, even if you don’t know Memory, like water, leaks from every broken vessel. Tie up the loose ends. Say sorry, even if you don’t mean it, Before you enter: Smiling and finally feeling brave enough To wave at those faces across the turnstile.\nAubade of the Insomniac No sleep, not tonight. The hours before daybreak Size you up with violet cat-eyes And with a thud, locked behind the insomniac’s bedroom door.\nHalf-past four, finding yourself\non streets which cannot remember where to end.\nCloaked specters linger at the corner:\n“Memory! You have the key…”\nIn a former life, these stars were once\nEmbers spiraling into the sky.\nYou walk past the old playground.\n“I never sleep, only dream,” says the insomniac.\nYou don’t know which way to go, only that you must go:\nElsewhere.\nTo that little hill where you discovered at five\nRocks shaped like dogs’ ears.\nShadows scuttle under the bamboos.\nWhat waltzes across the grass is you.\nThe first season of the years.\nPast the horizon, something stirred:\na flicker, at first, and suddenly the lights Burst forth, all at once:\nA Titan awakened from an ancient dream.\nDeep inside the city of ice, its blood-red heart beats\non every window, its pulse filling cracks and crevices\nof every room.\nTo the insomniac, dawn is liberation, salvation,\nDeliverance, rebirth, nirvana. A chance to live again.\nInside your room, the alarm clock sings its aubade. No one came.\nDeath of the Poet On the morning on which the poet dies,\nThe meadowlark does not stop her song.\nThe missile-heads will slit open the blue wound anew.\nThe young gods keep on making love.\nNo parade, or crusade, will put on display\nThe poet’s green, fatigued cadaver\nas it had once wished. Indeed, it would look\nmuch, much better in a blazing pyre.\nBut when, beyond the lagoons and beyond whispering pines,\nHis wandering soul knocks on Heaven’s lofty gates,\nThe keeper, recognizing his footsteps,\nwill greet him warmly and offer a place to stay:\nAnd before dawn, he will have sailed away without a farewell\nFor the pink light which lined the horizon of his every waking dream…\nFrom the New World For you, it might just be a tiny dot.\nA tiny red dot in tonight’s lustrous sky.\nYou pulled back the curtains:\nYou couldn’t wait for sunrise.\nBut it’s all wind and dust down here.\nIt creeps into every corner.\nIt creeps inside my bedroom. It forms the soft defiance in every pillow.\nThe substance of every dream.\nI wake up to the chirping of skylarks.\nSometimes it snows, but it doesn’t rain.\nIn August one could hear the cicadas.\nI sing An die Freude to my bathroom mirror.\nThese machines are old, and I am dying.\nI play the same record over and over.\nNow the wind rises. Must we try to live?\nI push my face against this distance\nThis great emptiness.\nWord and song seems so pale.\nAnd poetry so futile.\nOh, the mysteries of life!\nWhere did it begin? Where does it end?\nYou couldn’t wait for sunrise.\nYou pulled back the curtains:\nA tiny red dot in tonight’s lustrous sky.\nFor you, it might just be a tiny dot.\nLegend of the Knight Translated from the original poem ​​​​by Li Bai (701–762 AD)\n​​A warrior from Zhao in a tasseled hat,\n​​His fine blade gleaming like frost.\n​​Silver saddle on a white horse,\n​He rides, swift as a meteor.\n​​Every ten steps he kills another man.\nHe could go a thousand miles leaving no trace.\n​When it’s finished, he will be gone\n​Without leaving a name.\n​He came along to Lord Xin Ling\n​Laid his sword in front of his knees.\nFeasting with Zhu Hai, and\n​Holding the glass high, toasted to Hou Ying.\nAfter three cups, they made a pledge for life and death,\n​​Those sacred mountains seemed so little in comparison.\nAll drunk with sight blurred and ears red,\n​​Their spirits high in the pale rainbows.\n​Waving a golden hammer, Zhao was saved;\nThe city was in awe.\nTheir stories were told in the capital\nFor a thousand autumns to come.\n​​Even in death, their chivalries are unparalleled\n​​Among heroes of the land.\n​Who would rather sit beneath their bookshelves,\nSpending their whole life on some magnum opus?\n",

<h2 id="vertigo">Vertigo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vertigo">#</a></h2>
<p>From dizzying heights, the earth we once knew <br>
drifted into a sea of whispers.</p>
<p>Not snow-capped peaks, nor treacherous straits <br>
could stop us anymore.</p>
<p>We flew over the town in half-light. <br>
Soft shadows scaled the low walls. The place</p>
<p>where every road began. The air was brisk, <br>
the foam sparkled rose-gold, the moon</p>
<p>pale and crystalline. Were we no longer <br>
just a burning memory?</p>
<p>And with a gasp I was wide awake, flailing fists <br>
where my majestic wings had been. Soaring so high</p>
<p>I could not see the ground. So I cried and cried— and then, <br>
into the thick haze, began my faithful falling—</p>
<h2 id="6-tankas">6 Tankas<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-tankas">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="one">One<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#one">#</a></h3>
<p>Outside, an instant <br>
passed, and I woke up ashore. <br>
If I were Vincent <br>
which shade of pastel blue can <br>
reveal the sky&rsquo;s secret door?</p>
<h3 id="two">Two<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#two">#</a></h3>
<p>When your meteor crashed <br>
Into my world, <br>
These long-extinct forms <br>
Came back to life <br>
As flames licked and undid <br>
Glacial epochs of time.</p>
<h3 id="three">Three<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#three">#</a></h3>
<p>After the downpour, cats emerged from underground abodes, <br>
along with bottles of amber promises <br>
ready to be reborn.</p>
<h3 id="four">Four<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#four">#</a></h3>
<p>A day&rsquo;s false start <br>
Starts with yesterday&rsquo;s <br>
Hangover, a wet wool carpet hangs above <br>
Train tracks, drawing smoke <br>
from faraway chimneys.</p>
<h3 id="five">Five<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#five">#</a></h3>
<p>afternoon— skipped class, <br>
sitting by the black marble <br>
and white oak trees, you <br>
watched the warm sunlight reflect <br>
and dance on three thousand lives.</p>
<h3 id="six">Six<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#six">#</a></h3>
<p>The wind scatters <br>
in the evening bells. <br>
The azure dome <br>
recedes into the heaven. <br>
My mother and father <br>
walking, hand in hand.</p>
<h2 id="ode">Ode<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ode">#</a></h2>
<p><em>To my mother</em></p>
<p>Earth has undergone<br>
ten revolutions, and I still<br>
rip off page after page<br>
from my notebook, till I&rsquo;ve drained<br>
all its soul, futile ink<br>
seeped into imperfections, its powers<br>
dissolved. And every<br>
          abrasive, intimate<br>
note, roots and fibers crumpled,<br>
lacerated,<br>
is tender reminder<br>
of your hysteria<br>
and my defeat,<br>
          and that awful<br>
relic— unbearable scar on your abdomen<br>
like a hallowed parasite<br>
I left you with. A pain so vivid<br>
and tidal, neither of us<br>
had asked for, but a glimpse of the prelude<br>
and the<br>
          epilogue. And in between<br>
I was the only miracle<br>
that tried to be. And I tried<br>
not to be you, I have<br>
tried so, so very hard<br>
to be good to me. And in the end<br>
our distance saved us from our mutual<br>
altruisms.<br>
          And last time<br>
I called, you said you found peace,<br>
and I think I found mine,<br>
too, and I&rsquo;m glad<br>
we both did. You had so often said:<br>
One must imagine Sisyphus happy.</p>
<h2 id="interstellar">Interstellar<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#interstellar">#</a></h2>
<p>Stay. Take a picture of that polaroid <br>
Before the color fades, even if you don’t know <br>
Memory, like water, leaks from every broken vessel. <br>
Tie up the loose ends. Say sorry, even if you don’t mean it, <br>
Before you enter: <br>
Smiling and finally feeling brave enough <br>
To wave at those faces across the turnstile.</p>
<h2 id="aubade-of-the-insomniac">Aubade of the Insomniac<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#aubade-of-the-insomniac">#</a></h2>
<p>No sleep, not tonight. The hours before daybreak <br>
Size you up with violet cat-eyes <br>
And with a thud, <br>
locked behind the insomniac&rsquo;s bedroom door.</p>
<p>Half-past four, finding yourself<br>
on streets which cannot remember where to end.<br>
Cloaked specters linger at the corner:<br>
&ldquo;Memory! You have the key&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
In a former life, these stars were once<br>
Embers spiraling into the sky.</p>
<p>You walk past the old playground.<br>
&ldquo;I never sleep, only dream,&rdquo; says the insomniac.<br>
You don&rsquo;t know which way to go, only that you must go:<br>
Elsewhere.<br>
To that little hill where you discovered at five<br>
Rocks shaped like dogs&rsquo; ears.<br>
Shadows scuttle under the bamboos.<br>
What waltzes across the grass is you.<br>
The first season of the years.</p>
<p>Past the horizon, something stirred:<br>
a flicker, at first, and suddenly the lights <br>
Burst forth, all at once:<br>
A Titan awakened from an ancient dream.<br>
Deep inside the city of ice, its blood-red heart beats<br>
on every window, its pulse filling cracks and crevices<br>
of every room.<br>
To the insomniac, dawn is liberation, salvation,<br>
Deliverance, rebirth, nirvana. A chance to live again.<br>
Inside your room, the alarm clock sings its aubade. No one came.</p>
<h2 id="death-of-the-poet">Death of the Poet<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#death-of-the-poet">#</a></h2>
<p>On the morning on which the poet dies,<br>
The meadowlark does not stop her song.</p>
<p>The missile-heads will slit open the blue wound anew.<br>
The young gods keep on making love.</p>
<p>No parade, or crusade, will put on display<br>
The poet&rsquo;s green, fatigued cadaver<br>
as it had once wished. Indeed, it would look<br>
much, much better in a blazing pyre.</p>
<p>But when, beyond the lagoons and beyond whispering pines,<br>
His wandering soul knocks on Heaven&rsquo;s lofty gates,</p>
<p>The keeper, recognizing his footsteps,<br>
will greet him warmly and offer a place to stay:</p>
<p>And before dawn, he will have sailed away without a farewell<br>
For the pink light which lined the horizon of his every waking dream…</p>

<p>For you, it might just be a tiny dot.<br>
A tiny red dot in tonight&rsquo;s lustrous sky.</p>
<p>You pulled back the curtains:<br>
You couldn&rsquo;t wait for sunrise.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all wind and dust down here.<br>
It creeps into every corner.</p>
<p>It creeps inside my bedroom. <br>
It forms the soft defiance in every pillow.<br>
The substance of every dream.</p>
<p>I wake up to the chirping of skylarks.<br>
Sometimes it snows, but it doesn&rsquo;t rain.<br>
In August one could hear the cicadas.</p>
<p>I sing <em>An die Freude</em> to my bathroom mirror.<br>
These machines are old, and I am dying.<br>
I play the same record over and over.</p>
<p>Now the wind rises. Must we try to live?<br>
I push my face against this distance<br>
This great emptiness.<br>
Word and song seems so pale.<br>
And poetry so futile.</p>
<p>Oh, the mysteries of life!<br>
Where did it begin? Where does it end?</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t wait for sunrise.<br>
You pulled back the curtains:</p>
<p>A tiny red dot in tonight&rsquo;s lustrous sky.<br>
For you, it might just be a tiny dot.</p>

<p><em>Translated from the <a href="https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E4%BF%A0%E5%AE%A2%E8%A1%8C_(%E6%9D%8E%E7%99%BD)">original poem</a> ​​​​by Li Bai (701&ndash;762 AD)</em></p>
<p>​​A warrior from Zhao in a tasseled hat,<br>
​​His fine blade gleaming like frost.<br>
​​Silver saddle on a white horse,<br>
​He rides, swift as a meteor.<br>
​​Every ten steps he kills another man.<br>
He could go a thousand miles leaving no trace.<br>
​When it&rsquo;s finished, he will be gone<br>
​Without leaving a name.<br>
​He came along to Lord Xin Ling<br>
​Laid his sword in front of his knees.<br>
Feasting with Zhu Hai, and<br>
​Holding the glass high, toasted to Hou Ying.<br>
After three cups, they made a pledge for life and death,<br>
​​Those sacred mountains seemed so little in comparison.<br>
All drunk with sight blurred and ears red,<br>
​​Their spirits high in the pale rainbows.<br>
​Waving a golden hammer, Zhao was saved;<br>
The city was in awe.<br>
Their stories were told in the capital<br>
For a thousand autumns to come.<br>
​​Even in death, their chivalries are unparalleled<br>
​​Among heroes of the land.<br>
​Who would rather sit beneath their bookshelves,<br>
Spending their whole life on some magnum opus?</p>
